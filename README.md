# Customer Retention Prediction
TL;DR
(project goal, context, data, model, result)

# Introduction

## Motivation
- A key to a company's growth is its **ability to keep customers** 
  - Keeping existing customers is more cost efficient than acquiring new ones
  - It speaks about brand attractiveness and customer experience 
- In the context of e-commerce, i.e., non-subscription based business, customer retention = **repeated visits from the same customer**
  -  Relevant questions to ask are how far apart visits need to be for a user to be considered as a returning user, and what events should be deemed as _visits_
  -  It is worth noting that the answers to these questions, and even the definition of customer retention, can vary across businesses
- Knowing if a customer will return is valuable
  - Help to distinguish different types of shoppers and understand their needs
  - Allow preemptive measures to prevent churns
  - An effective way to evaluate if a marketing campaign or a sale event is successful
